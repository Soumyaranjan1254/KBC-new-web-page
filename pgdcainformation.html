                    <p>First we diiscous about Fundamentals. Clasification of computer:- Coumputers are classified bordaly into three types according to constroction & working principle.

                    <p>Analog Computer, Degital Computer, Hybrid Computer</p>

                    <h2>No.1:- Analog Computer</h2>
                    <p>These computer works on the principle of measurement like pressure, temprature, speed, voltees, etc. They are used mostly industrial and process control system,
                         the cost is less and accuracy factor is less in this computer.

                    <p>These computers work on the principle of counting rather than measuring accuracy is very high in digital computer. It is costly also every where we find digital
                         computer.

                    <h2>Digital Computers Clasification</h2>
                    <p>Digital computers are further classified into 4 types they are MICRO COMPUTERS, MINICOMPUTERS, MAIN FRAME COMPUTERS, SUPER COMPUTERS.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Micro Computers:-</h2>
                    <p>These types of computers is called personal computer. As it is a single use system. Only a single permison work at a time. This is smallest size computer. It very easy to use. It is also classifed in to 3 types.</p>

                    <p>It is a multi user system. It allows 50 users to work at a time. It is used mainly for railway reservation and banking. It is medium in size.</p>

                    <h2>Super Computers:-</h2>
                    <p>This computer is fastest computer. Super computer are used for large scal numerical calculation such as weather fore casting, air craft designed.

                    <p>These types of computers has the feature of both anlog and digital. Data is processed and the out put may be prodused in printed form.

                    <h2>PROGRAMING LANGUAGE AND PAKEGE </h2>
                    <p>The language wich is used to comunicate between computer and user is known as the programing language.
                        Every computer has its own languages. There are two level of programing languages.
                    </p>

                        Low lable language.

                        Assemble leble language.

                    <h2>Machine Leble Language:-</h2>
                    <p>A series of on, off and signal(0,1) is the only meathod of comunication with a proceser.
                        All the instruction should be using binary cods.
                        The binary codes is called Machine Code or Machine Lable Language.
                        But writing program in the language is very difficult.
                        A user can't comunicate with the computer is he doesn't know.

                    <h2>Assemble Leble Language:-</h2>
                    <p>This language is also called generation language.
                        A program is werittend in assemble language must be translate is execute.
                        This translation can be done by a program, know assemble lable language.
                        The disadvantages of assemble lable language is that it is basic depended hence program written for a computer can't be an export.
                        He knows all about writing assemble lnguage program not difficult and time consuming.
